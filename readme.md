# Graph Simulator

## About

This project is started as a hobby project, my free time is very limited so pls forgive for the mistakes and bugs you find and open a [bug report](https://github.com/Janiaje/graph-simulator/issues/new?assignees=Janiaje&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) / pull request for them.


## Main goal

I tried to create an easy to use tool to learn and understand graphs and algorithms which are used to solve tasks on them.


## Feature requests

If you wish to see a new algorithm simulations, or you have a cool feature in mind, open a [feature request](https://github.com/Janiaje/graph-simulator/issues/new?assignees=Janiaje&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) for it!
Your wish might come true ;-)
